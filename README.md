InverseVIsTraffic
======

This is a repository containing all the code for our ongoing Eastern Massachusetts transportation application project.

The Julia code for solving the inverse Variational Inequality problem is based on the repository [InverseVIs](https://github.com/vgupta1/InverseVIs); an important modification is the calculation of the objective function. In addition, the normalization constraint has also been updated, which, we believe, is more natural in this particular application.


INRIX real data processing

Due to confidentiality of the data, currently the whole INRIX dataset can not be made publicly available. When dealing with this dataset, 
both Python and Julia have been used.
